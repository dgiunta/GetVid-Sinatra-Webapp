h1. GetVid Sinatra Application

This is just a rather simple little web application, made with Sinatra, that provides a nice interface for the GetVid video download and audio conversion library.

It uses the MooTools javascript framework and implements a very basic worker script to manage the queue of video downloads.

h2. Usage

Like most Sinatra apps, you can get this app up on it's feet simply by running the main app file with the following command:

<pre>
  ruby get_vid.rb
</pre>

That will start a local server, setup a database, and get a copy of the website ready and waiting for videos to download.

To start the worker process, in another terminal window run:

<pre>
  ruby daemons/vid_processor.rb
</pre>

That will start up the worker process that will endlessly ping the database for available videos to download / convert.
